Connecting to the VM through Remote Desktop Connection
(Done using Shawn’s video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyFeyBX9jIY)
1.	Open Remote Desktop Connection on your computer.
2.	Type in the current IP address allowed through the Firewall and :444. If it tries to log you in using your own personal username, make sure that after you click “Connect” you click “Show Options” to enter the correct username and the password is the Windows password you saved in the previous section. After clicking OK, you can ignore the warning about a missing certificate and continue anyways.

4.	Now you should be inside the VM. Make sure to logoff properly in the Windows start bar, because just closing the screen doesn’t actually log you out.
   
Connecting to ArcGIS REST Endpoint and Manager
(Done using Shawn’s video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyFeyBX9jIY)
1.	After the IP address in the search bar, add /arcgis/rest/services and it will take you to the REST endpoint. Now you know ArcGIS Server is running.
2.	To get to the Manager, add /arcgis/manager instead after the IP address.
**Spent about an hour because I had issues getting into the Server Manager without being on the VM itself and couldn’t understand why. I redid the process to get screenshots and it worked, so I believe I went wrong somewhere with my IP address in the first try.*
