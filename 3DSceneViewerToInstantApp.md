3.	I realized I didn’t make a legend in the Scene so I went back to Scene Viewer and just changed some of the styling so that I could try adding a legend in the Instant App. I was able to group the styling by genus and used a species of each to represent them, when I could find one.

4.	I went back to 3D Viewer configuration and had to re-add the scene so it would update. Now I have the option to add a legend in the Step 2 | Express step.

Header: creates a bar at the top of your scene with the title of the app on it.
Text alt for the map: allows you to create a text alt in case the map does not show up
Shortcuts menu: adds a button for users to toggle keyboard shortcuts
Legend: allows users to view the legend if you created one in Scene Viewer.
Enable hover pop-up: lets you enable pop-up info windows
Fixed pop-up location: lets you enable the pop-up window to stay in one place when moving around
Pop-up position: Lets you pick where the pop-up information window appears when users click on an object.

6.	I went through and selected most of the options, just so I could see what they all allow me to do once I’ve published the scene.
