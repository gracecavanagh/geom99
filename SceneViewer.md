Digitizing 2D Trees to 3D Trees in Scene Viewer (loosely done using this tutorial: https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/quick-exercise-scenes.htm)

1.	Open Scene Viewer and navigate in the search bar to your location
2.	Click add layer in the left bar, and click ArcGIS Web server, then input the REST endpoint URL. The image(s) below is the data shown as 2D points

3.	Click on the layer you want to make 3D in the left bar and select 3D object. You can choose in the dropdown which field you want to base the attribute of the 3D symbol on, and click on 3D object again to edit the style of the object.

4.	I added another layer with Portland buildings to get a good look at what the trees and buildings look like together. This layer already came 3D.

5.	I then saved this as a scene in my content so that I can see how it looks in 3D Instant Apps.
