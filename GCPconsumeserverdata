4.	Click on Share -> share as Web Map
5.	Resolve all warnings and/or errors -> Click Share.
6.	Do NOT attempt to open this in AGOL when you have stopped the VM. It can lead to problems.
** It was easy to get everything set up but I spent a really long time troubleshooting. Shawn nicely reminded me that without Duck DNS and the certificate, I wouldn't be able to see it in AGOL. I also found out everyone else had the same issue and didn't know why either. But it's working now."
